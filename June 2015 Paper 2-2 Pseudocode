TASK 1

A school keeps records of the weights of each pupil. The weight, in kilograms, of each pupil is recorded
on the first day of term. Input and store the weights and names recorded for a class of 30 pupils. You
must store the weights in a one-dimensional array and the names in another one-dimensional array.
All the weights must be validated on entry and any invalid weights rejected. You must decide your own
validation rules. You may assume that the pupils’ names are unique. Output the names and weights of
the pupils in the class.

TASK 2

The weight, in kilograms, of each pupil is recorded again on the last day of term. Calculate and store
the difference in weight for each pupil.

TASK 3

For those pupils who have a difference in weight of more than 2.5 kilograms, output, with a suitable
message, the pupil’s name, the difference in weight and whether this is a rise or a fall.
