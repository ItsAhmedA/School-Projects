TASK 1

A data logger records the temperature on the roof of a school twice a day, at midday and midnight.
Input and store the temperatures recorded for a month. You must store the temperatures in two onedimensional arrays, one for the midday temperatures and one for the midnight temperatures. All the
temperatures must be validated on entry and any invalid temperatures rejected. You must decide your
own validation rules. You may assume that there are 30 days in a month.

TASK 2

Calculate the average temperature for midday and the average temperature for midnight. Output these
averages with a suitable message for each one.

TASK 3

Select the day with the highest midday temperature and the day with the lowest midnight temperature.
Then output each of these temperatures, the corresponding day and a suitable message.


Hi = -10000 
Dayhi = 0 
Low = 10000 
Daylow = 0 
A = 1 
Totalmidday = 0 
Totalmidnight = 0 
DECLARE midday: ARRAY [1:30] OF DECIMAL 
DECLARE midnight: ARRAY [1:30] OF DECIMAL 

Repeat 
  OUTPUT 'Enter midday temperature' 
  INPUT tempday 
  OUTPUT 'Enter midnight temperature' 
  INPUT tempnight 
  IF (tempday > -50 and tempday < 60) AND (tempnight > -50 and tempnight < 60 THEN 
    Totalmidday = Totalmidday + 1 
    Totalmidnight = Totalmidnight + 1 
    IF tempmidday > Hi THEN 
      Hi <-- tempmidday 
      Dayhi <-- A 
    Else
      IF tempmidnight < Low THEN 
        Low <-- tempmidnight 
         Daylow <-- A 
      ENDIF
     ENDIF
     midday[A] <-- tempday 
     midnight[A] <-- tempnight 
     A = A + 1 
  ELSE  
    OUTPUT 'Invalid' 
ENDIF 
Until A = 30 

Avgmidday = Totalmidday / A 
Avgmidnight = Totalmidnight / A 

OUTPUT Avgmidday
OUTPUT Avgmidnight
OUTPUT "The temperature for the highest midday was " , Hi , " It was the " , Dayhi , " Day." 
OUTPUT "The temperature for the lowest midnight was " , Low , " It was the " , Daylow , " Day."
